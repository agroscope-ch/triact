## Get the example data 
Download the example data from https://xyz.com and unzip it. The data includes four raw data files from a triaxial accelerometer (MSR145, MSR Electronics, Switzerland) mounted to a hind leg of a dairy cow. The sampling frequency was 20 Hz. Each file represents one day of recording. 

```{r}

dir <-  "example_data" # adjust (path to the downloaded example data)

list.files(dir)

```
